# Weather-App
The Weather App gets location data and uses an express server to query Open Weather API for weather of the given
coordinates. You can viwe a weather snapshot on a map based on the current weather data collected from the API. This
data includes location data and weather data.
This is a weather application based on [Joey Lee's](https://github.com/joeyklee) [The Weather Here](https://github.com/joeyklee/the-weather-here).
